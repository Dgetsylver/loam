# Loam

Build **composable**, **upgradeable**, **secure** Smart Contracts. 

Build frontends that interact easily with (your own or anyone's) Smart Contracts.

Focus on the important parts of your [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) / [Stellar](https://developers.stellar.org/) app. Let Loam handle the tedious bits.

At a high level, Loam is comprised of three main components:

1. [Loam SDK](./crates/loam-sdk) - The Software Development Kit (SDK) are for writing smart contracts by creating and assembling **subcontracts**. Think of subcontracts as lego blocks you can snap together into a more complex whole. Currently, the SDK is focused on Stellar/Soroban smart contracts, but the subcontract pattern can be made to work with other blockchains as well.
2. [Loam Frontend](https://github.com/loambuild/frontend?tab=readme-ov-file#loam-dev) - Modern frontend tooling paired with declarative environment configurations to help with local, test, and live blockchain networks.
3. [Loam CLI](./crates/loam-cli) - Command Line Interface (CLI) for building smart contracts authored with Loam SDK. It's also for easily working with smart contract dependencies in a Loam frontend.

This project is a monorepo containing code primarily for Loam SDK but also for Loam CLI, both of which share build code.

## What's in [./crates](./crates)?

Organized hierarchically:

- [Loam SDK](crates/loam-sdk) - Tool for creating subcontracts.
  - [loam-subcontract-core](./crates/loam-subcontract-core) - The most basic and essential subcontract, which manages admin/ownership and redeployability.
  - [loam-sdk-macro](crates/loam-sdk-macro) - Code for the `#[subcontract]` macro to create your own brand new subcontract, if existing subcontracts do not suffice.
- [Loam CLI](crates/loam-cli) - Build smart contracts authored with Loam SDK, manage smart contract dependencies from a frontend, initialize new loam projects
- [loam-build](crates/loam-build) - Used by CLI and SDK to look at dependencies and build contracts in the correct order.
- [loam-soroban-sdk](./crates/loam-soroban-sdk) – This is a wrapper around [soroban-sdk]() that extends it with features needed by Loam SDK.
- [loam-subcontract-ft](./crates/loam-subcontract-ft): like `loam-subcontract-core` above, this contains the source code for a subcontract. This subcontract is mostly in this repository as an example; see below.
